Question A: with this option the CA serial number file is created if it does not exist: it will contain the serial number "02" and the certificate being signed will have the 1 as its serial number. Normally if the -CA option is specified and the serial number file does not exist it is an error.

Question B: With openssl using -extfile and specifying an extentionfile would force generation of a version 3 certificate.

Question C: Extensions are used as restrictions on the certificate. A certificate with extensions cannot be used without fulfilling the extensions restrictions.

Question D: Should not be done since the certificates should have different serial numbers.

Question E: The truststore passwords protects the integrity of the truststore so that no one can change what certificates the system trusts.
The keystore passwords protects both the integrity of the keystore, as well as each of the keys inside the keystore.

Question F: It takes the message sent from the client, inverts it, and sends it back. E.g. 123 returns 321.

Question G: If changed to setNeedClientAuth(true) to setNeedClientAuth(false) the server gives a message saying that the client died.
Client authentication is not needed.

Client died: peer not authenticated
